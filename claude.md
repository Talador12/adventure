# Adventure — Project Status

See `AGENTS.md` for architecture, build commands, and conventions.

## Rules
- Update this file with every commit.

## Branch Strategy
- `staging` — active development
- `main` — stable releases

## Current Focus

Character management shipped (edit mode, KV persistence, server sync). Next: multiplayer identity and AI DM.

## Working Items

### Character management (save/load)
- **Status:** Done
- Edit mode at `/characters/:id/edit` — pre-fills all fields, updates in place
- KV-backed server persistence with localStorage fallback
- API: `GET /api/characters`, `PUT /api/characters`, `DELETE /api/characters/:charId`
- Server sync: loads from server on mount (merges), saves on every change (fire-and-forget)
- Edit button + clickable name on Home page character cards
- KV namespaces: `CHARACTERS` binding in dev/staging/production (IDs need `wrangler kv namespace create`)

### Wire Discord profile data into WebSocket
- **Status:** Todo
- Use Discord avatars and display names in lobby/game
- Currently WebSocket sessions don't carry Discord identity

### AI DM via Workers AI
- **Status:** Todo
- Narration, NPC dialogue, encounter generation
- Feed character appearance descriptions into DM context
- Use Llama for text generation

### Map system improvements
- **Status:** Backlog
- Procedural generation, better fog of war
- DM tools: god mode, roll override, visibility toggles

### Persistent campaigns
- **Status:** Backlog
- Save/load game state via KV/R2
- Character sheets with live updates and autosave

## Backlog

- Export formats: Pathfinder 2e, Forbidden Lands, Savage Worlds
- Portrait gallery — save/browse generated portraits, remix styles
- Sound FX — mood music, spell effects, combat sounds
- Shared doodle pad over WebSocket (broadcast strokes)
- Discord integration for voice/chat
- Particle effects for spells and combat
- Dynamic difficulty control
- Modular engine for homebrew rules and mods
- Accessibility "Low-FX" mode
- Drop-in/drop-out guest characters
